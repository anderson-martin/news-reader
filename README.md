# news-reader

This Minimum Viable Product is an Android based news-reader. For this project, I have implemented followings:
* Flexible splash page without extra delay
* Click effect (light flashing after clicking on each categorie thumbnail)
* Gridview with custom adapter
* Listview with custom adapter
* Transition effect

Flexible splash page which appears to user just for loading time, without any extra delay.
