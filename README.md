# news-reader

This Minimum Viable Product is an Android based news-reader. For this project, I have implemented followings:

* Transition Animation
* Click effect (light flashing after clicking on each categorie thumbnail)
* Flexible splash page without extra delay
* Fully customized status bar and action bar
* Gridview with custom adapter
* Listview with custom adapter


Flexible splash page which appears to user just for loading time, without any extra delay.

Mockups and design materials (icons, logos, etc) of this project, were done by Qvik company. I turned their prototype into this app.
